    <p>But how do we exit the matrix of our minds?
        Hereâ€™re six ways/things you can move beyond your mind and experience something other than the everyday illusion of reality it has created.
    <br> 1. Let go of the illusion that the material world means something <br>
    2. Let go of the idea that you are you <br>
    3. Let go of the idea that you can exit the matrix through the mind <br>
    4. Understand that only by journeying inward will you escape the matrix <br>
    5. Freedom from the matrix <br>
    6. Returning to the world changed by the journey </p> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
